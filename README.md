# 🌱 Terminal Farm

A simple terminal-based farming game in Python.  
Plant, grow, and harvest crops — all from your terminal!

# About

This repository contains **two versions** of our terminal farming game:

---

## 🌾 Legacy Version

- **File:** `hellofarm.py`
- **Description:** The original version of TerminalFarm, written entirely in a single Python file. Fully functional and nostalgic — it represents the early days of the project.
- **Usage:** Run it with `python hellofarm.py`

---

## 🧩 Modular Version (in progress)

- **Directory:** `TBD/`
- **Description:** A modern, community-driven rewrite of the game, with modular, reusable components. Designed for scalability, clarity, and easier collaboration.
- **Usage:** See the instructions in `TBD` to get started.

## 🤝 Contributing

- Contributions are welcome for both versions!
- The modular version is the main focus for ongoing development.
- The `hellofarm.py` version is kept for historical reference (and it's still fun to hack on or learn from!).
